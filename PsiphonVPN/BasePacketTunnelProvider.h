// Notes on file protection:
// iOS has different file protection mechanisms to protect user's data. While this is important for protecting
// user's data, it is not needed (and offers no benefits) for application data.
//
// When files are created, iOS >7, defaults to protection level NSFileProtectionCompleteUntilFirstUserAuthentication.
// This affects files created and used by tunnel-core and the extension, preventing them to function if the
// process is started at boot but before the user has unlocked their device.
//
// To mitigate this situation, for the very first the extension runs, all folders and files required by the extension
// and tunnel-core are set to protection level NSFileProtectionNone. With the exception of the app subscription receipt
// file, which the process doesn't have rights to modify it's protection level.
// Therefore, checking subscription receipt is deferred indefinitely until the device is unlocked, and the process is
// able to open and read the file. (method isStartBootTestFileLocked performs the test that checks if the device
// has been unlocked or not.)
